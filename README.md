# RPS Bootstrap

This project is for you to type along with the Introduction to Bootstrap video. There are no automated tests, so `rails grade` won't do anything.

Experiment!

## Target

Here is the target that we're aiming for in this project:

## Snapshot of RPS CSS workspace

Here is a snapshot of the workspace I ended up with from the RPS CSS workspace:

I slightly re-organized the CSS afterwards; you can see the differences here, in this [git diff](https://github.com/demostudent10-appdev/rps-css/commit/5b527ed0d419c0d7c1a762bd287e36a9948ea4e4).

## Standard Workflow

 1. Start the web server with `bin/server`.
 1. Navigate to your live application preview.
 1. As you work, remember to navigate to `/git` and **Always Be Committing.**
